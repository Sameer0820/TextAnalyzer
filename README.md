# TextUtils

Developed a React based single page Web Application where you can analyze your text and get your text summary such as word and character count and average time to read it. You can also convert your text to upper case or lower case, remove extra spaces, change your text font, etc. There is also a preview screen.

## Setup

First clone this github repository. After that open terminal in the root directory and run `npm install`. This will install all the required dependencies. Make sure you have React installed in your computer.

Now in the terminal run `npm start`. Application will start running in http://localhost:3000/.

## Application Description

The home page will look like this:

There is also a dark mode toggle in the navigation bar. You can enable it and it will apply dark theme to the whole application and a alert will be shown in the screen specifying the change.
